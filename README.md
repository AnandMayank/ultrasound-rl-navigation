## A Fully Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound System for Thyroid Scanning
### Introduction: 
The current thyroid ultrasound relies heavily on the experience of the sonographer and radiologist,
which would be physically and cog- nitively exhausting. Here we report a novel fully autonomous robotic ultrasound 
system (FARUS) that can scan thyroid regions without human assistance. In this application,
human skeleton point recog- nition, image segmentation, and force feedback are used to solve the 
problem of thyroid localization. The orientation of the ultra- sound probe is adjusted via Bayesian optimization. 
By using FARUS, both transverse and longitudinal scanning of thyroid tissue can be performed, as well as real-time 
thyroid nodule detection with arti- ficial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Experimental results on human participants 
demonstrate that FARUS can perform high-quality ultra- sound scans in comparison with manual scans obtained by clinicians.
