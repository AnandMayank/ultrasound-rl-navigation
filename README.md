This code accompanies the paper "A Fully Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound System for Thyroid Scanning".
# Abstract:
The current thyroid ultrasound relies heavily on the experience and skills of the sonographer and the expertise of the radiologist, 
and the process is physically and cognitively exhausting. In this paper, we report a novel fully autonomous robotic ultrasound system (FARUS),
which is able to scan thyroid regions without human assistance and identify malignant nodules. In this system, human skeleton point recognition, 
reinforcement learning, and force feedback are used to deal with the difficulties in locating thyroid targets. The orientation of the ultrasound 
probe is adjusted dynamically via Bayesian optimization. Experimental results on volunteering participants demonstrated that FARUS can perform 
high-quality ultrasound scans, close to manual scans obtained by clinicians, may detect thyroid nodules and can provide data on nodule 
characteristics for ACR TI-RADS calculation.
