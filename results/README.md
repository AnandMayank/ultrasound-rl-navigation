## Segmentation Examples

The `segmentation_examples/` folder contains:
- Original ultrasound images
- Generated segmentation masks
- Overlay visualizations showing segmented regions

These demonstrate the ResNet U-Net model's ability to accurately segment abdominal regions in ultrasound images.

## Navigation Training

The `navigation_training/` folder contains:
- Training metrics (rewards, distances, oscillations)
- Training progress plots
- Multiple GIF animations showing agent behavior during training:
  - `episode_100.gif` - Early training behavior
  - `episode_200.gif` - Improved navigation patterns
  - `episode_300.gif` - More refined movements
  - `episode_400.gif` - Near-optimal navigation
  - `episode_500.gif` - Final trained behavior

These show how the DQN agent learns to navigate efficiently to target centers with reduced oscillations over the course of training.

## Navigation Demos

The `navigation_demos/` folder contains:
- Main demo: Complete step-by-step navigation sequence with `navigation.gif`
- Additional episodes showing different navigation scenarios:
  - `episode_2/` - Alternative navigation example
  - `episode_5/` - Mid-training navigation behavior
  - `episode_8/` - Different ultrasound image navigation
- Initial and final states for each episode
- Segmentation visualizations

These demonstrate the complete pipeline working on various test images with different navigation patterns.

## Trained Models

The `trained_models/` folder contains:
- `simple_resnet_unet_best.pth` - Best segmentation model weights
- `agent_final.pt` - Final trained navigation agent

These models can be loaded and used for inference on new ultrasound images.
